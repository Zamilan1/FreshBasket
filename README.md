Fresh basket
Background of the firm:
Fresh Basket is a small startup involved in delivering fresh fruits and vegetables using an online platform. The company currently uses a traditional on-premise server to manage all customer orders, inventory, and processing of payments. Fresh Basket now wants to expand the operations in consideration of a growing, robust, scalable, and cost-effective IT solution.

Recommendations:
AWS would be the best fit for Fresh Basket, since it follows a pay-as-you-go model, supports scaling of applications, and managed services such as Amazon RDS for databases and AWS Lambda for serverless computing.
Examples:
Fresh Basket does more than 500 orders per day. Their on-premise server sometimes struggles with high traffic, especially during offer days. They need a cloud-based infrastructure that can ensure uptime, fast processing, and scalability.
Solution:
A cloud-hosted web application: Ec2 instance for the backend and an S3 bucket for static content.
